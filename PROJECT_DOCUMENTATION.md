## 📝 Abstract

The **Social Feed Application** is a full-stack social media platform demonstrating advanced database management concepts. The application enables users to create profiles, share posts, engage through comments and likes, and receive notifications.

Built with MySQL 8.0, Node.js, Express, and React, the system features:
- 7 normalized database tables with foreign key relationships
- 6 database triggers for automatic counter maintenance
- 3 stored procedures for complex queries
- 3 stored functions for computed values
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- RESTful APIs with comprehensive validation

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Objectives:**
- Design normalized relational database schema (3NF)
- Develop stored procedures, functions, and triggers
- Create secure RESTful API with JWT authentication
- Build responsive React frontend
- Demonstrate ACID properties and transaction management
